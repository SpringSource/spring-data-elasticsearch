= Upgrading from 4.0.x to 4.1.x

This section describes breaking changes from version 4.0.x to 4.1.x and how removed features can be replaced by new introduced features.

== Deprecations

.Definition of the id property
It is possible to define a property of en entity as the id property by naming it either `id` or  `document`. This behaviour is now deprecated and  will produce a warning. PLease us the `@Id` annotation to mark a property as being the id property.

[[elasticsearch-migration-guide-4.0-4.1.removal]]
== Removals

.Type mappings
The _type mappings_ parameters of the `@Document` annotation and the `IndexCoordinates` object were removed. They had been deprecated in Spring Data Elasticsearch 4.0 and their values weren't used anymore.
