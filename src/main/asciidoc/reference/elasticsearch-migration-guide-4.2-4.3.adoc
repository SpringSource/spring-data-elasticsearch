=== Handling of field and sourceFilter properties of Query

Up to version 4.2 the `fields` property of a `Query` was interpreted and added to the include list of the `sourceFilter`. This was not correct, as these are different things for Elasticsearch. This has been corrected. As a consequence code might not work anymore that relies on using `fields` to specify which fields should be returned from the document's
`_source' and should be changed to use the `sourceFilter`.
